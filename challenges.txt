Challenges:
	The hardest part for me was optimizing the whole pipeline.Spend a whole day trying to
	filtering out unwanted lines's data from hough_line. 
	About the challenge, Idon't have much time left to work on it, but  I have a guess 
	that problem is coming up from Canny edge detection, mainly. Since it mixes the 
	edges from all sort of lines in the image. However, again filtering must be a 
	challenge too. 
	Curious to know how we should optimize it.
	
	Thanks! :)
